Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:
Why do we need data structure?
Answer: In order to locate and rettieve  data it is required to have data in a structured form. Structured form of data makes  retrieval and manipulation easy.

1. Searching
2. Sorting
3. Insertion
4. Deletion
5. Merging

what is an Array?
An array in programming is a collection of data/value which has index associated with it. An array shall contain similar types of data, an array can be sorted or un sorted.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Answer:
1. Array length if fixed but arraylist is dynamic.
2. Array members are accessed using [], but ArrayList has a set of methods
   to access elements and modify them as because aerialist is collection of framework in java.
3. Array can store primitive variables and objects but arraylist can store oly Objects.
what is LinkedList?
Answer: A linked list is linear data Structure where each element is a separate object which is called node. Each node has data and reference to the next node. Last node has reference to null.
How is an Array different from Linked List?
Answer: 1. An array element is having index number, but a node is having reference to next node.
        2. In array each element is independent, does not have any connection to the other element
         on the other hand in linked list each node are connected by previous node.
        3. In Linked list, location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous
         element/node. In array, no pointers are used like linked list so no need of extra space
         in memory for pointer.
        4. Linked list consumed extra memory as the link location need to be saved in in the linked
        part of the previous elements in case of array it is not required.
what is queue?
Answer: It is a linear data structure where elements can be accessed  ob the basis of FIFO.
what is stack?
Answer: Stack is linear data structure where elements can be accessed on the basis of LIFO.
what is FIFO and LIFO?
Answer: FIFO: First in first out. Example: In Queue data can be accessed by FIFO method. LIFO: Last in first out. Example: In Stack elements can be accessed on the basis of LIFO.
what is the order of complexity?
Answer: For input is of size N, we can say that the algorithm will finish at O(1), O(N), O(N^2), O(N^3), O(N*log(N)) etc. Complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of time and/or space required by an algorithm for an input of a given size (n). It signifies the total time required by the program to run till its completion. Most commonly expressed using the big O notation. It is most commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary steps performed by any algorithm to finish execution.
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Answer: Best case - you find it (assuming you only need to find one) on the first comparison.
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Answer: Assuming there are no duplicates for the expected value and it is the last one in the array - the nth comparison.
what is tree in data structure?
Answer: A tree is a widely used abstract data a type or data structure implementing abstract data type. It is a hierarchical tree structure, which has root value and subtrees pf children with parent node, represented as a set of linked notes.
what is graph in data structure?
Answer: A graph is pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by link. The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices are called edges.
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Answer: 1. HashMap is non-synchronized. This means if it’s used in multithread environment then more than one thread can access and process the HashMap simultaneously. Hashtable is synchronized. It ensures that no more than one thread can access the Hashtable at a given moment of time.
        2. HashMap allows one null key and any numbers of null values. HashTable doesn't allow null key and null values.
        3. HashMap implementation LinkedHashMap maintain the insertion order and tree map sorts the mapping based on the ascending order of keys.
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
Answer: The major data structures used are as follows:
        1. RDBMS - Array
        2. Network data model - Graph
        3. Hierarchical data model - Trees
How HashMap works in java?
Answer: A HashMap element has key and value in Java, elements are stored against a key. Map Interface implemented on HashMap in Java Collection Framework. elements manipulation is easy on the basis of key of the value.
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
Answer: It is a class in Java API, which extends IndexOutOfBoundException. IndexOutOfBoundsException occur when an array has been accessed with an illegal index. Index either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Answer: There are mainly four different ways to copy all elements of one
array into another array in Java.
1. Manually, 2. Arrays.copyOf() 3. System.arraycopy() 4. Object.clone()
1. Manually: Copy elements one by one.
2. Arrays.copyOf(): We can directly copy one array to another by using Arrays.copyOf() method.
3. System.arraycopy(): Using this method.
4. Object.clone(): We can also use clone() method to make a copy of array.
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Answer: 1. An array element is having index number, but a node is having reference to next node.
        2. In array each element is independent, does not have any connection to the other element on the other hand in linked list each node are connected by previous node.
        3. In Linked list, location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous element/node. In array, no pointers are used like linked list so no need of extra space in memory for pointer.
        4. Linked list consumed extra memory as the link location need to be saved in in the linked part of the previous elements in case of array it is not required.
What is DFS and BFS?
Answer:Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structure This one starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Breath-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structure. It starts at the tree roots and explores the neighbour nodes first before visiting to the next level of neighbours.
What is Recursion?
Answer: When a method calls himself inside the method is called recursion. The method which causes recursion is called recursive method.
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
Answer: Linear data structure: 1. Array, 2. Stack, 3. Queue, 4. LinkedList; Non-Linear data structure: 1. Trees 2. Graphs
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Answer: Big O notations is describes the performance or complexity of an algorithm. BY seeing this it is possible to understand how first the algorithm is. Big od specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used by an algorithm. Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
